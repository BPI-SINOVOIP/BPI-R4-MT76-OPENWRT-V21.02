  # Enable BinAuth Support.
  # If set, a program is called with several parameters on authentication (request) and deauthentication.
  # Request for authentication:
  # $<BinAuth> auth_client <client_mac> '<username>' '<password>'
  #
  # The username and password values may be empty strings and are URL encoded.
  # The program is expected to output the number of seconds the client
  # is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the authentification request
  # to be rejected. The same goes for an exit code that is not 0.
  # The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:
  # <seconds> <upload> <download>
  #
  # Called on authentication or deauthentication:
  # $<BinAuth> <*auth|*deauth> <incoming_bytes> <outgoing_bytes> <session_start> <session_end>
  #
  # "client_auth": Client authenticated via this script.
  # "client_deauth": Client deauthenticated by the client via splash page.
  # "idle_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because of inactivity.
  # "timeout_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because the session timed out.
  # "ndsctl_auth": Client was authenticated manually by the ndsctl tool.
  # "ndsctl_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by the ndsctl tool.
  # "shutdown_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by Nodogsplash terminating.
  #
  # Values session_start and session_start are in seconds since 1970 or 0 for unknown/unlimited.

  #
  # A simple login script is provided in the package.
  # This generates a login page asking for usename and email address.
  # User logins are recorded in the log file /tmp/ndslog.log
  # Details of how the script works are contained in comments in the script itself.
  #
  # The Preauth program will output html code that will be served to the client by NDS
  # Using html GET the Preauth program may call:
  # /nodogsplash_preauth/ to ask the client for more information
  # or
  # /nodogsplash_auth/ to authenticate the client
  #
  # The Preauth program should append at least the client ip to the query string
  # (using html input type hidden) for all calls to /nodogsplash_preauth/
  # It must also obtain the client token using ndsctl (or the original query string if fas_secure_enabled=0)
  # for NDS authentication when calling /nodogsplash_auth/

  # Your router may have several interfaces, and you
  # probably want to keep them private from the gatewayinterface.

  # initial request not using the router itself as a DNS server,
  # Leave commented to help prevent DNS tunnelling
